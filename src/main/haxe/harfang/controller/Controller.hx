/**
 * A controller handles requests from the client. Instances of controllers are
 * by the URL dispatcher to handle requests from the client.
 *
 * Methods from a controller may be mapped to an URL by the user in a module
 * either by adding the maps manually into the module or by annotating
 * controller methods (see the MacroConfigurator class in harfang.configuration
 * for more details)
 *
 * When a controller method is found to match a certain URL, the URL dispatcher
 * will call the following, in order : init, handleRequest, the mapped method
 * and handlePostRequest.
 *
 * Throughout the documentation of this interface, the "mapped method" refers
 * to a controller method that has been mapped and succesfully matched to an URL
 * by the URL dispatcher.
